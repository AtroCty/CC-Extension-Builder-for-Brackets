##Contributions

Contributions are welcome, but be sure what you want to contribute to.

Internally, this project is basically a view on top of a simple node domain which calls the [Creative Cloud Extensions CLI](https://github.com/davidderaedt/CCEXTCLI) to deploy an extension template based on a modified version of the [Creative Cloud Extension boilerplate](https://github.com/davidderaedt/ccext-boilerplate) (Standard).

So, if you want to contribute to the GUI or general UX, this is the right place.

If you want to improve the way CC extensions are deployed on the user's system, you should contribute to [Creative Cloud Extensions CLI](https://github.com/davidderaedt/CCEXTCLI).

If you want to build better default templates for generated CC extensions, go to [Creative Cloud Extension boilerplate](https://github.com/davidderaedt/ccext-boilerplate).
